His blood pressure remains higher than optimal at this  juncture as evidenced by his detailed home blood pressure recordings. His  ideal blood pressure is less than 130/80 in the setting of CKD, should he  tolerate this without orthostatic symptoms. I have added lisinopril 10 mg p.o.  daily to his current regimen and will repeat basic chemistries in 2 weeks to  ensure that his BUN, creatinine and potassium are stable. I have encouraged  him to continue to restrict his dietary sodium intake and gradually lose weight  as he is able. Two other changes in his blood pressure medications can be  considered in the near future. First, metoprolol-XL is probably a better  choice than atenolol given his CKD, though such change is not urgent with his  current level of kidney function and lack of symptomatic bradycardia.
