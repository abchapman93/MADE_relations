He has not had a radio immunoconjugate therapy, but I think this may well be problematic because of our prior problems with his blood counts. My plan would be to treat him with a couple of cycles of cyclophosphamide and prednisone with or without vincristine and I will look at his old records to determine whether he tolerated previous vinca alkaloid therapy reasonably well. It will be easy to determine whether he is responding since he has obvious peripheral lymphadenopathy. In the meantime, he will continue home peritoneal dialysis. His management continues to be complicated by a pattern of minimizing symptoms to the point where they are almost concealed and I should emphasize that his most recent hospital admission really was precipitated by his wife's providing the history that he had been confused for a few days prior to the visit. He continues to smoke, although he does tell me today that he has started to use a nicotine patch and he is aware that he cannot use the patch and continue to smoke at the same time.

Her initial clinical presentation was with 3-4 months history of B symptoms manifested as fevers and night sweats and also a 30-pound weight loss. In addition, she also developed shortness of breath and trouble swallowing that prompted her to visit the ER on [** Date **], and imaging studies with CXR showed mediastinal mass and a CT scan subsequently revealed a large 7 x 9 cm mass sitting in the anterior mediastinum with possible invasion to the SVC and extension into the adjacent left upper lobe.   PATHOLOGY: The immunophenotypic and morphologic features are more consistent with mediastinal large B cell lymphoma.
